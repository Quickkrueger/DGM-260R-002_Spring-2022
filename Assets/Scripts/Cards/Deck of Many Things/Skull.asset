  cardDescription: You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad
    in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space
    of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others
    that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops
    to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper
    summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't
    be restored to life.
