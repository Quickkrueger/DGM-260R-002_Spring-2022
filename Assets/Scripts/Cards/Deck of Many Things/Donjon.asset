  cardDescription: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation
    in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays
    behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned
    until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any
    divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You
    draw no more cards.
