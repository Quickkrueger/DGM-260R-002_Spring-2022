  cardDescription: This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your
    body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful
    beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is
    incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the
    location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
